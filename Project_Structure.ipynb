      "If you're doing anything but the simplest one-off exploratory analysis, it turns out to be extraordinarily helpful to make everything you do **easily repeatable**.  At its simplest, this consists of a few guidelines:\n",

      "1. Do everything from a script.  (Or at least: If you perform an action, add it to a script so that you remember it later.)\n",

      "Recording the pipeline: `make`\n",
      "-------------------------------\n",
      "`make` is a special purpose tool designed for managing dependencies.  The basic model is that you have a bunch of sections that look like\n",
      "\n",
      ">     target_file: dependency_file1 dependency_file2....\n",
      ">             some command to run\n",
      ">             a command to run after it\n",
      ">             ....\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, when you type `make target_file` make will first check if all of the dependecy files are are up-to-date.  If they are not, it will first make _them_.  Once that's done, it will run the commands in order.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you just run `make` without specifying a target, it will run the top one in the file.  It is customary for this to be something like\n",
      "\n",
      ">     all: [all your 'top-level' target]\n",
      "\n",
      "**Caveats and gotchas:**\n",
      "  1. What does up-to-date mean?  `make` is based around the idea of actual _files_ (not just abstract targets) and so it will check if the file exists (if not, it has to be made) and if it does it will use its _filesystem timestamp_ to determine if it has changed since the last run.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This means that if you want to force target_file to be remade, you could either delete it or run `touch dependency_file1` to update the timestamp on dependency_file1.\n",
      "\n",
      "  2. It is white-space sensitive.  Worse, see those spaces before the commands: they are TABs, not spaces.  The use of fixed tabs has fallen out of favor lately, so it may be difficult to make your text-editor actually put a space rather than 4 spaces.  For instance, in IPython Notebook the easiest way is to copy-paste in a tab from elsewhere!  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  (In the code sample below, the little arrows are teling us that it is really a tab.)\n",
      "  \n",
      "  3. Nowadays, we often do things other than generating output files from input files.  For instance, we might write to the database.  Or we might perform an operation where we do not know -- a priori -- the names of the files it will generate (i.e., downloading some sequence of files).  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  `make` doesn't want to know.  The fix is to use a \"sentinel file\" -- an empty file whose presence (or absence, or timestamp) indicates whether our operation has been done.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  4. Make has a complicated variable substitution system.  Fortunately, it's not really necessary to know much of it.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Okay, so let's see the example for our project.  I'm going to present it as a \"fait acompli\" and then work towards filling in various script files it references (explaining then how they play a role).\n",
      "\n",
      "Before writing out the Makefile, let's have a look at our goal: we will represent the Makefile graphically before seeing how to write it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will have four main goals: each represented by a pink box (the name in it is the name of the sentinel file we will use).  The other boxes in the same colored group are the ordinary files that it depends on: e.g., actual steps in the middle or source code that generates the next step.  Arrows indicate dependencies."
