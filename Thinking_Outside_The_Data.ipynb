      "## Data Fidelity\n",
      "----------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Data generators and data producers are different people.  Sometimes there's no feedback loop between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Did one consistent source generate the data or did multiple?\n",
      "1. Do keywords always mean the same thing?  Topic tags on articles often have a large number of contributors with unsynchronized taxonomies.  Some websites, e.g. wikipedia, have reasonably right editorial guidelines but in general, this is not strict.\n",
      "1. Sometimes, there are implicit tags that don't appear.  For example, most restaurants in Japan would probably be considered \"Japanese\", but most restaurants aren't labeled as \"Japanese\", because they are already implicitly assumed to be by their users.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Was the data processed by a 3rd party that inadvertently obscured certain fields?  How can you tell?\n",
      "1. Sometime null data is encoded as a special number (e.g. 9999, -1, 0) but this can lead to ambiguity because those could always be valid data values.**Question**: how can you distinguish between them?\n",
      "1. Sometimes data processing goes amuck and data is just silently dropped.  **Question**: how can tell if some data was silently dropped in a data file?\n",
      "\n",
      "### Systematic (pathological?) ways in which people interact with the system that cause biases in the data?\n",
      "1. **Rounding**: where true value of the data is obscured by rounding.  If you poll people on how much money they make annually, you'll likely find values divisible by \\$1,000 or \\$5,000 show up disproportionately often.  **Question**: Is this reflective of reality?  How would you deal with it?\n",
      "1. **Human Habits**: sometimes, what appear to be rounded values might not have been rounded.  If you look at the histogram of the number of shares executed per trade, you'll see huge peaks at 100 or 500 shares.  People like round numbers.  Similar, intervals between trades are often 1 sec or 30 secs.\n",
      "1. **Spurious visits**: looking at web logs, you'll often see the same user visit a webpage multiple times within a few seconds.  You often want to consider that one visit becasue they are probably refreshing their browser because of a slow connection.  For similar reasons, you'll get multiple checkins at the same venue within a few minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### External factors that influence your data\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, completely external factors can influence an outcome:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Presidential elections see a spike in babies born with the president's first name.\n",
      "1. If you are analyzing the effect of an online banner ad campaign, was their a TV campaign while you were showing your banner ad?\n",
      "1. The stock market is a classic example of where external events can have a huge influence on data.\n",
      "1. In housing data, credit standards were loosened leading up to '08 which lead to the spike in defaults when the economy collapsed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unique codes are not always unique\n",
      "1. Congressional districts and zip codes get shuffled around.  Be careful when inferring facts like \"the 3rd Congressional District of some state because very Republican.\"\n",
      "1. Similarly, stock IDs (which are suppose to be a stable way to identify companies across time periods), change do to mergers and acquisitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Joining data sets from different sources\n",
      "1. Sometimes you can have unique keys provided by 3rd parties.  For example, there are a few schemas for security ids and venue ids provided by different third parties.  Social Security Numbers, and Employer ID Numbers are meant to be a uinque key provided by the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service.  **Question**: How would you join records about companies or individuals without such a unique key?\n",
      "1. If one of the databases is at a coarser level of granularity, e.g. zip code or household level, you might be able to join the data based on that level by aggregating another dataset to that level."

      "## Data Relevance\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "\n",
      "### Temporal or cohort effects (especially in economic data):\n",
      "1. If you ran a trading strategy in '92 to '00 and then '02 - '07, you probably would have made a lot of money.  That doesn't mean you would have made money '00 - '02' or '08 - '10.  There's a huge debate in economics about the validity of the \"Ergodicity Assumption\".\n",
      "1. Similarly, with housing data, the underlying credit underwriting standards changed in ways that mean there are really strong cohort effects.\n",
      "1. In user website user data, we often get different cohort effects: early users might be those who were drawn to early features and be more reluctant to adopt new features.  The website or app changes with time so different cohorts experienced different lifecycles of the product.\n",
      "**Quesitons**: How do you control for this?\n",
      "\n",
      "### Is your data available at decision time?\n",
      "1. Exmaple: for a search engine, the position at which a result is displayed affects the probability of getting a click.  This is a natural feature to incorporate in a model.  However, that information is not available at the time of decision making.  **Question**: how do you control for this when estimating a model?\n",
      "\n",
      "### What kind of time duration and frequency of your data\n",
      "1. **Mistmatched data**: It is easy to get ~ week of Twitter data by sampling the firehose.  You have millisecond frequency data at a few weeks duration.  It is easy to collect stock market data from free sources at a daily frequency but with decades of duration.  Unfortunatley, when you try to join these two datasets at the finest common level at the longest common interval, the intersection would be a few weeks of daily data, which is not that impressive.\n",
      "1. **Decision making time scale.**  If you are making quarterly marketing decisions for a CPG company, you don't need up to the minute Twitter data.  Similarly, if you need to make secondly decisions about what product to display on an E-Commerce site, quarterly consumer spending data released quarterly by the govenrment might not be that useful.\n",
      "    \n",
      "### How do you calculate the value of new data?\n",
      "1. If you generate a new signal, how would you quantify its value?  It's easy to say \"it decreased MSE by _\" but we often care about an impact in terms of business metrics.  \n",
