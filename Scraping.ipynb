    "Today we'll see talk about \"scraping\": getting unstructured data and turning it into something usable.  The tools available through Python are mature and easy to use.  We'll focus primarily on _web scraping_, where the source data comes in HTML form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic workflow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Find the data you want on the web.\n",
    "2.  Inspect the page you're dealing with, to figure out how to zoom-in towards the content you want.  This will involve some combiation of\n",
    "    - Looking at the source code of the page (especially if it is simple), and\n",
    "    - Figuring out the structure of the HTML parse tree.  This step is much easier with a something like __Chrome Developer Tools__.\n",
    "3.  Write code to get out what you want:\n",
    "    - If the page is very simple, treat it as a bunch of text => __string manipulation / regular expressions__ in Python.\n",
    "    - If the page is more complicated (and/or written in good style), we want to use the HTML parse tree => __BeautifulSoup__ in Python.\n",
    "4.  Make sure it worked!\n",
    "5.  If your crawling problem is at all non-trivial, you will now have to go back to Step 2 to zoom in further -- or you'll have parsed the URL of a link you want to follow, in which case you'll go back to Step 1 to figure out how to parse what you want from the new target page."

    "- _Second try_: Let's just search for all technologies at http://technology.mit.edu/technologies.  Okay, better but it only gives us 50 at a time.  We could just combine the four pages, that's fine.  Let's just click on page 2 to see what happens\n",
    "- _Third try_: Aha, the URL for page 2 is http://technology.mit.edu/technologies?limit=50&offset=50&query=.  That looks like we can just specify a higher limit and offset 0 and get the whole thing.\n",

(a) Setup of the system. Larvae in liquid phase of ultra-low gelling temperature agarose hydrogel are automatically loaded from a reservoir into the system with a microfluidic component, and arrayed onto a surface-treated plate as single larva-containing hydrogel droplets. Both the loading reservoir and arraying plates are placed on motorized X–Y stages, and the loading and dispensing nozzles are mounted on motorized Z stages. Depending on the desired orientation, the larvae are either agitated with a vibrating motor attached to the plate (for dorsal-up orientation) or anesthetized prior to loading (for lateral orientation). Larvae are immobilized by cooling with a thermoelectric cooler to rapidly solidify the hydrogel droplets. The system automatically identifies each larva, positions the targeted region under the injectionmicropipette, and detects the contact and penetration of the tip of the micropipette. A computer-controlled pressure driven microinjector is then triggered to inject test compounds into the target organ. After injection, a self-adhesive bottomless multi-well chamber is attached to the plate and the larvae are recovered from the hydrogel by gently flushing each droplet with embryo medium.

(a) Setup of the system. Larvae in liquid phase of ultra-low gelling temperature agarose hydrogel are automatically loaded from a reservoir into the system with a microfluidic component, and arrayed onto a surface-treated plate as single larva-containing hydrogel droplets. Both the loading reservoir and arraying plates are placed on motorized X–Y stages, and the loading and dispensing nozzles are mounted on motorized Z stages. Depending on the desired orientation, the larvae are either agitated with a vibrating motor attached to the plate (for dorsal-up orientation) or anesthetized prior to loading (for lateral orientation). Larvae are immobilized by cooling with a thermoelectric cooler to rapidly solidify the hydrogel droplets. The system automatically identifies each larva, positions the targeted region under the injectionmicropipette, and detects the contact and penetration of the tip of the micropipette. A computer-controlled pressure driven microinjector is then triggered to inject test compounds into the target organ. After injection, a self-adhesive bottomless multi-well chamber is attached to the plate and the larvae are recovered from the hydrogel by gently flushing each droplet with embryo medium.

    "** Introduction to CSS selectors**\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern -- where you have nested finds, each given by conditions on tag type, id, and class -- is very common.  It's so common that there is a special convenience language for such traversals: [CSS selectors](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "BeautifulSoup supports a form of CSS selectors, and this will let us write the above in a more concise and expressive way:\n",
    "    >    tech_divs = soup.select('div#nouvant-portfolio-content  div.technology')\n",
    "\n",
    "All selectors work like a 'find_all'.  Some basic building examples of selectors are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - _'mytag'_ picks out all tags of type _mytag_.\n",
    " - _'#myid'_ picks out all tags whose _id_ is equal to _myid_\n",
    " - _'.myclass'_ picks out all tags whose _class_ is equal to _myclass_\n",
    " - _'mytag#myid'_ will pick all tags of type _mytag_ **and** _id_ equal to _myid_ (analgously for _'mytag.myclass'_)\n",
    " - If _'selector1'_ and _'selector2'_ are two selectors, then there is another selector '_selector1 selector2'_.  It picks out all tags satisfying _selector2_ that are __descendents__(*) of something satisfying _selector1_, i.e., it's like our nested find.\n",
    " \n",
    " (*) It doesn't have to be a _direct_ descedent.  I.e., it can be a grand-grand-..-grand-child of something satisfying _selector1_.  For direct descendents we'd instead write _'selector1 > selector2'_\n",
    " \n",
    "Let's just explain how this applies to our example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Let's start with the first half\n",
    "        >    tech_divs = soup.select('div#nouvant-portfolio-content  div.technology')\n",
    "        >                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n",
    "This picks out all 'div' tags with id 'nouvant-portfolio-content'.\n",
    "2.  Then the second half\n",
    "        >    tech_divs = soup.select('div#nouvant-portfolio-content  div.technology')\n",
    "        >                                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n",
    "This picks out all 'div' tags with class 'technology'.\n",
    "3.  Finally the whole thing\n",
    "        >    tech_divs = soup.select('div#nouvant-portfolio-content  div.technology')\n",
    "        >                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n",

If we were to run the above test twice, we'd probably find that some of the failures were just due to a connection error.  We didn't notice this because the _outer_ `try` / `except` is also catching these.  So: Modify `get_tech_details` to allow up to 3 retries. <br/>Bonus points if you actually look what what exceptions `urllib` throws in those cases instead of a general catch-all mechanism.  Alternate type of bonus points if you figure out how to do it using the `retrying` package.  You can test these by throttling your internet on and off to simulate an unreliable connection."
